    "[Django Built-In Template Tags and Filters:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) You should bookmark this page, because you'll refer to it often as you work on Django projects. It's the entire list of built-in template tags and filters that you have access to when you use Django. In other words, it's a gold mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Refresher__\n",
    "\n",
    "{% for x in y %} - For loop in Django templates\n",
    "\n",
    "{% extends \"template.html\" %} - Causes the current template to extend the quoted template so you can override blocks in the parent template.\n",

    "{% block name %}{% endblock %} - Marks the start and end of a named block which can be replaced with inheritance.\n",

    "### Teacher's Notes\n",
    "[Managing Static Files:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/static-files/) The Django documentation goes into more detail about how Django serves static content in different environments. If you'd like more detail than what we've gone into here, I recommend checking out the docs. Always read the docs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Notes\n",
    "* Best to store global static files in a directory called 'assests' inside your projects main directroy.\n",
    "* Best to store app specific static files in a directroy structered like so: '/<project dir>/<app dir>/static/<name of app>/'. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "#### Adding App specific CSS to projects\n",
    "1. Inside /learning_site/courses/, add the follow directory structure and file: ./static/courses/css/courses.css\n",
    "2. Inside courses.css add the following:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".card header a {\n",
    "      color: #000080;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Inside the head tag, below 'layout.css' link tag of layout.html add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% block static %}{% endblock %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Inside of course_list.html add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% load static from staticfiles %}\n",
    "\n",
    "{% block static %}\n",

    "## Handy Dandy Filters\n",
    "### Teacher's Note\n",
    "[More on Humanize:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/humanize/) The Django documentation on the `humanize` set of filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Notes:\n",
    "* Remember that a filter is applied to a variable that you pass into your template from your view, and uses the pipe notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Inside course_detail.html, add the following below `{{ course description }}`:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>There are {{ course.step_set.count }} step{{ course.step_set.count|pluralize }} in this course: {{ course.step_set.all|join:\", \" }}</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "    * `{{ course.step_set.all|length }}` would also work (in place of count), but it creates alot of extra work in that has to execute a large database query.\n",
    "    * `{{ course.step_set.count }}` - Provides the number of steps for course.\n",
    "    * `{{ course.step_set.count|pluralizer }}` - Makes a word plural based on the count.\n",
    "    * `{{ course.step_set.all|join:\", \" }}` - Produces the nice comma seperated steps. Without join filter you get the ugly query set syntax\n",

    "## Using Template Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "#### Loading a template library\n",

    "    'django.contrib.humanize',\n",
    "    'courses',\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Inside course_detail.html, add the following to the top of the file:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% load humanize %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Update the `<p>` we created earlier to the following:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>There are {{ course.step_set.count|apnumber }} step{{ course.step_set.count|pluralize }} in this course: {{ course.step_set.all|join:\", \" }}</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "    * `apnumber` - For numbers 1-9, returns the number spelled out. Otherwise, returns the number. This follows Associated Press style\n",
    "#### Shortening variable names on the fly\n",
    "4. Inside step_detail.html, change `{{ step.content|linebreaks }}` to following:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% with con=step.content %}\n",
    "    {{ con|linebreaks }}\n",
    "{% endwith %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Challenge\n",
    "1. Add code that will display how many flavors of ice cream there are in the query set flavors using the count filter.\n",
    "2. Finally, list all of the flavors of ice cream in the unordered list below. Use either a for tag to list all the flavors in `<li>` tags or the unordered_list filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
