    "# Django Tutorial\n",
    "by Kenneth Love\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is web framework designed to be out of the box ready, however it does have a lot of great third party libraries to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are CMS's?\n",
    "* CMS stands for Content Management Systems.\n",
    "* Their development was driven by the need publish newspaper content online.\n",
    "* Django was orginally developed to be a CMS at a newspaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Django is used by:\n",
    "* Instagram\n",
    "* Mozilla\n",
    "* Pinterest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Django\n",
    "```pip install django```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other Django Tutorials\n",
    "[Django Basic Poll Application](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Project\n",
    "`django-admin.py startproject learning_site` or `django-admin startproject learning_site` will get the project started (Creates a project skeleton essentially). We won't need django-admin again for the rest of our work in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is manage.py?\n",
    "* Used to run commands for a project, its kind of like Django Admin.\n",
    "    * Could be used to create a new application\n",
    "    * Could be used to migrate a database\n",
    "    * etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Inside of learning_site (or the name you specified after `startporject`) Directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is settings.py?\n",
    "* Just holds all the settings for your applicaton.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is urls.py?\n",
    "* Will contain all the base URLs for the application you build.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is wsgi.py?\n",
    "* Controls how your application will be served on the internet, such as wether your using AWS or Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Server\n",
    "* `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` will run the server for Workspaces. On your own computer, you probably don't need the `0.0.0.0:8000` part.\n",
    "    * You'll probably get something like the following error message when run this command for the first time:\n",
    "        * ```You have 13 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.\n",
    "Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.```\n",
    "        * This is normal, and wil go away once you run `python manage.py migrate`\n",
    "    * When this command is run for the first time a sqlite3 database 'db.sqlite3' is created at the root. You can configure another db to be setup by default like MySQL or PostGreSQL. You'll definitly want to switch to over to one of those (or any other pro db system) once you take your project live.\n",
    "* `python manage.py migrate` will apply all pending migrations from all apps. More on apps later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are migrations?\n",
    "Migrations are a way of moving a database from one design, a specific set of tables and columns, to a new one. Migrations are reversible, too. The fact that they can be done backwards and forwards is what gives them their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello World in Django\n",
    "Django is a MVC, or Model View Controller Framework.\n",
    "* Django refers to templates as templates and functions that return rendered templates as views.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`HttpReponse`__ is the class that represents an HTTP response back to the client. The way we used it in this video is the absolute simplest way of generating a response. It's not the most useful tool in the shed, but it's the gateway to all of the other HTTP tools we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about [`HttpResponse`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/request-response/#httpresponse-objects) and about Django's [view functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/views/).\n",
    "\n",
    "__`url()`__ is a function that constructs a special object that Django uses to join URLs to view functions.\n",
    "* Django's URLs are created with Regular Expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "* Create a views.py file inside the stub directory (a dir inside the root dir).\n",
    "* Type the following in views.py:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello_world(request):\n",
    "    return HttpResponse('Hello World')\n",
    "```\n",
    "*The `request` argument is a variable name convention for incoming http requests. It is a requirement for all views.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* In urls.py type the following imports below the Django imports:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from . import views\n",
    "```\n",
    "*The dot just means import such & such from the current directory.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the following to the `urlpatterns` list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "url(r'^$', views.hello_world)\n",
    "```"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "The `url` function can actually take up to five arguments:\n",
    "    * Regular Expression pattern: `r' '`\n",
    "    * View (function) to send the request to: `<views_py_file>.<view_name>`\n",
    "    * kwargs for the view\n",
    "    * name for the route\n",
    "    * A prefix\n",
    "* Run `python manage.py runserver`, and check localhost at port 8000 for the 'Hello World' text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our First App\n",
    "Django projects contain multiple Django apps. Each app generally encompasses a specific area of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "__```python manage.py startapp```__ creates the skeleton of an app including the views, models, and tests files.\n",
    "* Creates a few `__init__.py` files, which mark a directory a python module FYI. They are what allows us to import things from inside those directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "__```INSTALLED_APPS```__ is a list of all apps that Django should consider installed and active for the current project. These apps will be used to find templates, tests, models, and migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "__```TIME_ZONE```__ is the setting for what time zone your server is running in. [The docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-TIME_ZONE) explain a little more and there's a [list of time zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "* From the root of your project run `python manage.py startapp courses`\n",
    "* Inside `settings.py` add the string 'courses' to the end of the INSTALLED_APPS list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are models?\n",
    "Think of model classes as a way for python to make a database table, and the attributes of that class are the table's columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "`django.db.models` has most of the model functionality you'll use to create models and their fields.\n",
    "* `DateTimeField` holds datetime objects.\n",
    "* `CharField` holds strings.\n",
    "* `TextField` holds an unspecified amount of text.\n",
    "* [More](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/) Django model field types.\n",
    "\n",
    "`python manage.py makemigrations [app]` will make the migrations for a specific app.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[Here is the list](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/) of `manage.py` commands.\n",

    "* Write the following a few lines down from the import statements.\n",
    "\n",

    "class Course(models.Model):\n",

    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n",
    "    description = models.TextField()\n",
    "```\n",
    "*auto_now_add is essentially using datetime.datetime.now, but with the current time zone set in settings.py*\n",
    "* Since we've created a new Model class we need to update our table. We need to specify what has changed by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python manage.py makemigrations course\n",
    "```\n",
    "* That command should return with the following:\n",

    "Migrations for 'courses':\n",
    "  courses/migrations/0001_initial.py\n",
    "    - Create model Course\n",
    "```    \n",
    "If you examine '0001_initial.py', this is what migration syntax looks like for Django.\n",
    "* To put the migration into practice we run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python manage.py migrate courses\n",
    "```\n",
